# Air Quality Prediction Project

## About the Project
Air pollution is getting worse every year because of vehicles, factories, and city growth. Pollutants like PM2.5 and PM10 affect our health and environment. The goal of this project is to use machine learning to predict the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** so that people and governments can take action in time.

## What I Did
- Collected and cleaned the dataset,  
- Explored patterns in pollutants and weather,  
- Built machine learning models with Python,  
- Predicted air quality for short-term forecasts,  
- Measured how well the models performed.  

## Dataset
- Source: Air_Quality.csv  
- Data includes pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, CO, O₃), weather info (temperature, humidity, wind speed), and AQI.  

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## Outcome
The model gives AQI predictions which can be used for health warnings, traffic plans, and better environmental management.
